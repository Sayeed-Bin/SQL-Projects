#1. Sales and Customer Transaction Analysis:
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover customer purchasing behavior, trends, and patterns. It involves querying transaction records to generate insights on sales performance, customer preferences, and product demand. Key metrics like total sales, customer frequency, and average transaction value are evaluated using SQL queries.

#2. Employee Performance and Compensation Analysis:
This project examines employee performance and compensation data to assess productivity, reward distribution, and efficiency. By querying employee records, performance metrics, and salary information, SQL queries are used to analyze trends, identify high performers, and correlate compensation with performance outcomes.

#3. Inventory Management and Stock Optimization:
This project focuses on managing inventory data to ensure optimal stock levels. SQL queries are used to analyze stock movements, identify fast-moving and slow-moving products, track reorder points, and optimize stock replenishment. Insights generated help streamline inventory processes, reduce waste, and improve supply chain efficiency.
